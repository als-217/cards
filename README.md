A way to convert subtitles to flashcards.

Dictionary from: https://kaikki.org

Simply download the dictionary and a set of subtitles (in excel) and input them, along with an output file, and it will return a csv with the words and their definitions. It is currently written for use with German. The resulting csv file can be input into Anki to create flashcards.
