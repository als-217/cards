A way to convert subtitles to flashcards.
Dictionary from: https://kaikki.org

Simply download the dictionary and a set of subtitles (in excel) and input them, along with an output file, and it will return a csv with the words and their definitions. It is currently written for use with German. The resulting csv file can be input into Anki to create flashcards.

Obviously this is not perfect since words can have different meanings depending on context, but it was still useful for learning subject specific vocabulary for a TV show I wanted to watch. Additionally, in German (and in other languages) there are words that are both nouns and verbs. Hence, the wrong definition may be applied. Example: planen and das Planen. Therefore it is advisable to have at least beginner knowledge in a language before using the script to automate flashcard creation.

The script runs for about 10-15 minutes for 8 episodes of a TV show. So despite some inaccuracies it saves considerable time, and headache, making 1000+ flashcards.
